Why Design Patterns?

Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems that developers face repeatedly. 
Think of them as tested recipes or blueprints that guide you on how to structure your code.

Key Points:
- They don't provide exact code that you copy and paste
- Instead, they give you a template or approach for solving problems
- They help you write cleaner, more maintainable code
- They make it easier for other developers to understand your code

Benefits:
- Save time by using solutions that have already been tested
- Avoid common mistakes that others have already solved
- Communicate design ideas more effectively with your team
- Make your code more flexible and easier to change later
